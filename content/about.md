# About

Greentechdev is an initiative by the [Swedish Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.naturvardsverket.se) (Naturvårdsverket) to support developers to make use of our data and services. We belive that well managed environmental data is of significant benefit and makes a difference for the environment. GreenTechDev is an explorative test platform for usability tests created by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. In this mission a source of inspiration is the site [JobTechDev](https://jobtechdev.se) by the Swedish Public Emplyment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen). The purpose is to develop easy-to-use open data and services in the environmental domain. Following are the API:s and prepackaged data files that are made available in this test. Don’t hesitate to [contact]({{< ref "support.md" >}}) us, for things missing, suggestions and alterations!
