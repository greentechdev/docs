# Cookie policy

## What are cookies?

A cookie is a piece of data from a website stored on the visitorâ€™s computer by the web browser. Typically to remember preferences, sessions (for example to keep track of whether a user is logged in or not), or track behavior (e.g. pages visited). 

If set by the website the user is visiting, it's called a first-party cookie, while a cookie set by external services the website is using is called a third-party cookie.   

## Why we use cookies

To improve this website and the services provided via the website, we use cookies to analyze how our visitors use the website. 

## The cookies we use

Please note that we use [Google's option to anonymize the IP-address](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052) of the visiting user to be as privacy friendly as possible. This means that nor Google nor us will store the only personally identifiable piece of information we could collect - i.e. your IP-address.

## How to opt out?

There are several ways to avoid having cookies placed on your computer in general, and for this website in particular:

### Block the use of cookies

Most web browsers allow you to completely block all-, or only third-party cookies. This often results in some websites stop working properly.

### Do not track (DNT)

If you enable [DNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) in your browser, it will send a do not track-request to each website you visit. The owner of a website can then choose to adhere to this request or not. In our case we do respect this request, and do not set any cookies if DNT is enabled.

### Reject cookies

At your first visit to this website we'll display a banner asking for your approval (or disapproval) to use cookies. Rejecting means we will only set a cookie to remember your choice.
